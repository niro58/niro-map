			<strong>Nichita Roilean</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") operates the niromap.com website

	<section>
		<h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
		<p>
			We collect a minimal amount of information for the sole purpose of providing and improving the
			Service.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h3>a. Automatically Collected Data (Log Data):</h3>
			<p>
				Like most website operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you
				visit our Service. This may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol
				(IP) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the
				time and date of your visit, and other diagnostic data. This data is used for system
				administration, security analysis, and to improve the Service. It is not used to personally
				identify you.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>b. Location Data:</h3>
			<p>
				When you use the "search by radius" feature, you may provide us with location information by
				pinning a location on the map. This location data is used only to perform the search and
				display relevant points-of-interest. We do not store this location data after your session
				ends, nor do we associate it with your IP address or any other personal information.
			</p>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>2. Cookies, Browser Storage, and Analytics</h2>
		<p>
			We believe in respecting your privacy. Our Service is designed to function without storing any
			information on your device.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Cookies:</strong> We do not use cookies for tracking, analytics, or any other purpose.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Local &amp; Session Storage:</strong> We do not use your browser's Local Storage or Session
				Storage to store data. Application state, such as your current map view or search filters, is
				stored directly in the page URL.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Plausible Analytics to understand our website traffic. Plausible
				is a privacy-focused analytics tool that does not use cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR,
				CCPA, and PECR.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Because we do not store or access any data on your device, a cookie consent banner is not
			required.

		<p>
			The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over
